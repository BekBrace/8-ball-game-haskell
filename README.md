# 8-ball-game-haskell
This is a Magic 8 Ball game coded in Haskell
I decided to write this in Haskell, as an excercise.
The game I coded it 8 years ago in Python when I first was learning Python.
And again I'm doing the same thing when I'm learning Haskell.
I guess this is my "Hello world" type of application :)
